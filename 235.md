**From 2009 the genesis block of bitcoin was mined to the present, with every blockchain application boom(FT, NFT, Defi, Dex, Restaking etc), the only thing that remains unchanged is token, more specifically, its issuance and standard.**

Through the fact, we have the following views,

- Unchanged token standard makes tokens be the most extensive blockchain infrastructure.

- With cheaper gas fee and more complexe app logic, the trend of expanding functionality of tokens based on original standards is beginning to emerge.

- Tech and app innovations that aim to lower the threshold for issuing tokens will be more easily recognized by the market.

We can't help but ask ourself a question what would happen if we make token transfer to be the fundamental and generalized access to all web3 applications? It means you swap on dex via token transfer, deposit fund in defi via token transfer, play fully on-chain games via token transfer, claim airdrop and so on.

This is a collection of `ERC20` extensions that focus on enpowering the token transfer in order to realize "transfer to do something".

It includes also an experimental implementation of `ERC20` token. Its differences with standard token are that:

- it's designed to testing erc20 extensions and most importantly, to test the `Transfer2X` idea via `ERC20TinyScriptShard`.

- any address can claim `1 * 10 ** decimals` token for free by transfering 0 to himslef. It's done by the `Transfer2Claim`, a variation of `shard0:ERC235`.

- it supports install extensions (in a way like hooks after transfer) and shards.

- its transfer would not influence balances. Users can transfer as normal, but neither sender nor receiver's balance will change.

- (todo) its balance is designed to indicate the degree of testing involvement of an address. The more the address is involved in testing, the higher the balance is.

## ERC20TinyScript

There has already been tens of `ERC20` extensions. But most of them focus on the financial attribute of token, wchich means they are designed to manage fund or data related to fund, as well as `ERC20PoS` an extension introduced later. So how could we make token transfer be flexible enough to support all kinds of onchain interaction?

`ERC20TinyScript` is an extension for `ERC20` that utilizes the last 9 decimal places of transfer amounts to execute additional logic. It's based on a premise that the price of `1 token` is better to be lower than `$1M`. Then `0.000000001 token` worth less than `$0.001`. Considering the fundamental transaction fee for token transfer, any token amount less than `0.000000001` can be ignored. In another word, users would have no sense to the last 9 decimal places of transfer amount and it is not used deliberately. So we choose to make full use of it.

> This will encounter a problem when users swap tokens on dex. We might need to set the pool's address as an exemption to avoid the additional logic being executed. Or we should recommend developers to have some address related checkouts before executing the additional logic.

For a smart contract developer, it's like now you have one additional input parameter to customize your transfer logic. How to use this "new input parameter" is entirely up to you. Maybe you can use it as the condition of a big switch. Maybe you can use it to encode the data you expect. In conclusion, `ERC20TinyScript` provides a way to improve utilization of input data of a standard `ERC20` token transfer. The last 9 decimal places of the transfer amount is about 30 bits. If this is not enough, `ERC20TinyScript` also accept data attached to the end of transfer calldata.

```

Although for each `ERC20` token contract that implements `ERC20TinyScript`, their usage of tiny script are different, it's still possible to summarize some common usecases some day. For this reason, we extend the `ERC20TinyScript` contract to `ERC20TinyScriptShard`, which split the first three dicimal places of the original 1e9 spaces into 1000 shards, and each shard can be used to represent a common usecase. This is a way to standardize the use of `ERC20TinyScript` and make it easier to understand and use. So `ERC235` comes.

## ERC235

`ERC235` is the first shard of `ERC20TinyScript` with shard id `0`. It is a standard for token tree and their inner call. `235` stands for nuclear chain reaction. The idea is that a token tree with standard structure and inner call way is like a nuclear chain reaction, where a token transfer is like a nuclear fission, and the inner call triggered by token transfer is like a neutron that triggers the next fission.

### Token Tree

A token tree is a tree structure that represents the relationship between different tokens. Each node in the tree represents a token and can have up to one parent and up to 999999 children. A node of which the parent is itself is the root of the tree. A node must have a parent before it can have children. For each node, its children are mapped from 1 to 999999. The mapping is done when you link two nodes as parent-child with a provided number. The number will then be used as the child id.

> Specially, a node can be an arbitrary contract, not necessarily a token contract, as long as it implements the `IERC235` interface.

### Inner Call

An inner call is a call that is initiated by a node to one of its children. The call is triggered by a transfer of the token represented by the node. The child called is determined by the last 6 decimal places of token amount(the first 3 of 9 are limited to 0 because `ERC235` is the shard with id `0`).

## ERC20PoS

`ERC20` is an extension for `ERC20` that adds a function to calculate the token balance accumulation over time. This value is called `PoS`, stands for Proof of Stake and got by calling `posOf(address account, uint256 from, uint256 to) returns (uint256 res)`, the newly added function. Its result is the sum of `token_unit_balance` at each block within a time period. The `token_unit_balance` is the token balance without decimal. For example, an address with balance `10 * 1e18`, its `PoS` within 10 blocks would be `100 = 10 * 10`.

This extension is designed to give `ERC20` a native way to have signt on an account's historical balance. It can be used as a reference for those projects who wants to motivate early adopters or long-term holders.

There are two different implementations, `ERC20PoS` and `ERC20ClassicPoS`. `ERC20ClassicPoS` measures the global(from block 0 to latest block, input params of `posOf` for block range would not change its result) `PoS` of each address, while `ERC20PoS` measures the `PoS` of each address within any block range. For exchange, `ERC20Pos` spends more gas than `ERC20ClassicPoS` for `transfer` and `posOf` function call.

### Transfer2Claim

`Transfer2Claim` is essentially a variation of `ERC235`. The parent-child relationship within a token tree is interpreted here as airlifter-airdrop. The parent is the airlifter and the children are the airdrops. Addresses pocessing the airlifter token can claim the airdrop token via the inner call function defined by `ERC235`. This means that an airdrop token gives its claim access to transfer of its parent(airlifter) token. But the eligibility and amount of the claim is determined by the airdrop token itself. The airdrop token can set a condition for the claim, and the claim will be successful only if the condition is met.

**The main pro of `Transfer2Claim` is making airdrop claim safer. In above way, airdrop claim will be done by a transfer of its parent(airlifer) token. Since all wallet support `ERC20`, eligible user can use any wallet to submit a token transfer instead of opening a certain website, which might put user's fund at risk. A manual token transfer with own wallet decision is the most secure airdrop claim and blockchain operation ever.**

> By design, it supports submiting an eligibility proof(provided by project owner in general) along with token transfer. But it quires extra data attached to the end of transfer calldata. We'd be happy to see some wallets support this feature in the future.

> `ERC20PoS` is a very good util for `Transfer2Claim` to set the condition of the claim. For example, if the airlifter token supports `ERC20PoS` extension, then the airdrop token can set a condition that the claimer must have a `PoS` of at least `10000` within the last `100` blocks. This requires an average balance of `100 * 10 ** decimals` of the airlifter token within the last `100` blocks.
